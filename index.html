            <h2>
                Food Security
            </h2>
            <p>
                Access to healthy foods is essential for personal well-being regardless of race, age, or other factors.
                For students and faculty at JHU, this access is often taken for granted given that on-campus dining,
                local stores and restaurants, and many other healthy options exist within just a few city blocks.
                However, this access is not a luxury for much of the U.S. and even within Baltimore, access to healthy
                food is limited by income inequality, access to vehicles or other transportation, and an uneven
                distribution
                of grocery options within a reasonable distance.
                Surprisingly, <b>food deserts</b> are pervasive and affect both urban and rural areas across the U.S.
            </p>
            <h3> Food Deserts </h3>
            <p>
                The USDA defines <b>food deserts</b> as regions with <em>both</em> low access to healthy food and low
                average income. The USDA provides systematic definitions of both low income and low access.  The
                definitions are based on US Census Tract data which captures sub-county population statistics.
                In short, low income is a function of the poverty rate and/or the median income within a tract relative
                to the state or local region. Similarly, low access is determined by significant low income
                populations within a low income census tract and without access to healthy food options.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to examine food desert prevalence in the U.S. and to assess whether this problem affects
                various racial and demographic groups equally.  In particular, we analyze food desert data for
                minority and vulnerable populations across varying regional areas.
            </p>
            <h2> Data </h2>
            <p>
                The USDA's Food Access Research Atlas [1] contains census-based data which provides tract-level
                information about food access across the country.  The USDA releases this data every 4-5 years
                (dating back to 2006) which provides useful longitudinal data capturing changes over the past few
                decades. For closest comparison across years, we focus our attention primarily on an eight-year period
                captured by data released in 2015 and 2019.
            </p>
            <h2> Distributions of Populations Impacted by Food Deserts </h2>
            <p>
                To give an overview of the populations affected by food deserts, we breakdown people affected by
                food deserts into races, age groups, vehicle availability status, and low-income status.
                For this analysis, we are using the tract flag that defines low access as <em>more
                than 1 mile (urban areas) or more than 10 miles (rural areas)</em> from the nearest
                supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store.
                Thus, the proportions can look very different if we choose a different definition of low-access. We only
                display data from 2015 and 2019 because these two datasets contain relevant details about racial
                groups. If we compare the distributions between 2015 and 2019, we can see that the makeup
                doesn't change too much over the eight year span.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we take a look at the various proportions, we can see that the White sub-population accounts for
                just over half of the
                population affected while Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander are the
                most affected  minorities. Around a quarter of people affected are kids (0-17 years old) while only
                around 12% are seniors (age 65+). This statistic would make sense since between the two vulnerable age
                groups, children are more dependent on care-takers and unlikely to have stable incomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first glance, the vehicle and low income distributions may seem counterintuitive since food deserts
                are defined as both low income and low access to healthy food. However, in the statistics, a tract is
                marked as a
                food desert if it is a <em>low income</em> tract with at least <em>500 people, or 33 percent</em> of the
                population, living more than 1 mile (urban areas) or more than 10 miles (rural areas) from the nearest
                supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store.
                Similarly, a low income tract is defined as a tract with either <em>a poverty rate of 20 percent or
                more</em>, or a median family income less than <em>80 percent of the State-wide median family
                income</em> ; or a tract in a metropolitan area with a median family income less than <em>80 percent
                of the surrounding metropolitan area median family income</em>. This suggests a more complicated
                process for determining food desert status.
                Thus, a household can be a high income family living in a neighborhood with high poverty rate, or have
                access to healthy food but live in a neighborhood where more than one third of the people have
                limited access. This demonstrates a limitation of this dataset in that it is counting food desert status
                by tract instead of by headcounts or households and thus does not really count for the variability of
                living conditions within those tracts.

            <h2> Racial Impacts of Food Deserts </h2>
            <p>
                One limitation of looking at raw numbers of people affected by food deserts is
                that the proportions can be easily misleading. By looking at the figure above, one may
                conclude that the White population is most affected by food deserts. In terms of total number of
                individuals, this is true.  However, if we take into account that the White population makes up
                around 76% of the entire population in the US, we can see that only a small portion of the
                White population is actually affected by food deserts yet minority populations are
                disproportionately impacted. To better understand the problem, we dive deeper into the racial impacts
                of food deserts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a look at the impacts of food deserts broken down by state and race in 2019.
                The figure is based on the food desert statistics within that state and shown for each racial group.
                Again, if looking at aggregate numbers, the statistics can be misleading showing that the White
                population is the most affected race while also suggesting that other subpopulations are relatively
                unaffected.
                However, if we examine how much of each subpopulation is affected relative to the total number
                of individuals in that subpopulation (dark blue bars), we see a significantly different story.
                This suggests that in fact <em>different racial groups are impacted unequally across states and of
                    greater concern is that minority groups experience these effects most often.</em>
            </p>
            <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                <div id="chartdiv"></div>
                <h6>Figure 2:
                    (Map) Fraction of total affected by food deserts according to race.
                    (Middle) Share of total population refers to how much a given race contributes to the state's total
                    population (independent of food desert status).
                    Share of subpopulation refers to how much of a given race's population is affected by food deserts.
                    This figure highlights that some races may account for only a fraction of their state's population,
                    but those same races may be disproportionately impacted by food deserts.
                    (Bottom) Statistics are shown for 2015 and 2019, so the bottom plot shows relative differences
                    (negative is better and indicates food desert impacts were smaller for 2019 relative to 2015 for the
                    associated race).

            </div>
            <p>
                By examining individual states, we can see that some racial groups are disproportionately affected by
                food deserts.  With the exception of the Northeast and California, much of the U.S. shows significant
                proportions of the population impacted by food deserts. The South (such as Georgia, North/South
                Carolina, and Tennessee) shows that black populations are impacted more severely than other
                subpopulations.
                Within the Mid-West and Southwest, we see higher food desert effects for American Indian groups
                despite the fact that their total populations are relatively small in those states.
                Across much of the U.S., Hispanic populations experience significant food desert effects often
                comparable to other highly-impacted minority racial groups in those state.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2> Food Deserts in Rural vs. Urban Populations </h2>
            <p>
                While food deserts are present in nearly every kind of community, the USDA defines them differently
                depending on whether the area (designated by census tract) is defined as rural or urban. In an urban community, a
                food desert is any low-income community where the nearest supermarket is at least one mile away. In a rural
                community, a food desert is any low-income community where the nearest supermarket is at least ten miles away. The reason
                for this distinction is because "low-access" can have different meanings depending on an area's resources. For
                example, driving 12 miles to the grocery store in a rural community might have an equal burden to taking a bus 3
                miles to the grocery store in an urban community.  While this distinction helps separate
                relevant differences between rural and urban populations, it still demonstrates that making these
                distinctions is challenging.  The USDA uses multiple rural/urban distance thresholds to get a more
                complete picture yet these may still not be optimal as U.S. population distributions change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, we visualize food access data in four different vulnerable populations, and encourage the user to
                examine both the urban and rural community data. The first population we explore is children living in food
                deserts. One can see that in the rural population, it is much more common for children to live more than 10
                miles from a supermarket than in urban areas. We also looked at the senior population for each community
                and distance. This was an important area to focus on because age, once again, changes the idea of access. It is a much
                greater imposition for an 80-year-old to walk two miles to the grocery store than it is for an able-bodied 25-year-old. We
                observe that while there are not as many seniors living in food deserts as there are children, there is still a significant
                amount, and the burden they face in accessing food is arguably much higher.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our third population is low-income individuals. This is a general definition of populations living in
                food deserts, since low-income is a prerequisite for a tract to receive the food desert designation.
                While there are many more people in urban areas living in food deserts than there are in rural areas,
                as one can see from the chart, it is important to consider that urban areas are more highly populated.
                Still, considering the differences in a food desert's definition based on community,
                this may indicate that urban areas are disproportionately affected by food insecurity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final population displayed is housing units receiving SNAP. SNAP stands for "Supplemental Nutrition
                Assistance Program." It is a federally funded program (formerly known as Food Stamps) that provides
                additional nutritional benefits for families and individuals to supplement their food budgets, so
                that they can access more healthy food choices. Our chart examines the 2019 set of houses receiving
                SNAP benefits, and their distances from the nearest supermarket.

                        disproportionately high number of
                        food deserts in urban populations, but also displays the high amount of food insecurity in
                        rural populations, which is not as well-known or discussed. Additionally, these charts show
                        the effect of food insecurity on older and younger populations, which must be considered
                        separately from the wider population given that their access needs are different.

                Food Desert Contributing Factors
            </h2>
            <p>
                We next attempt to determine major causes or correlating factors for food desert prevalence according to
                race. Since many statistics such as median income, poverty rate, etc. are not broken down by race in the USDA
                FARA, we attempt to approximate these statistics at the race-level as follows.  For each census
                tract, we identify the race that contributes the highest number of individuals to the tract's
                population.  Then, by aggregating over all tracts we can get an estimate for which races "dominate"
                which tracts. Filtering by tracts marked as being both low income and low access, we can see for each race the
                fraction of food desert tracts where that race is predominant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, for each race, we then look at the average poverty rate, median income, SNAP participation, and
                lack of vehicle access (while also living greater than a half mile from a supermarket) taken across all
                tracts where that race is dominant and the tract is also in a food desert. These aggregate statistics
                help to highlight which factors might
                be contributing toward the food desert designation.  For instance, for food desert tracts where the
                dominant race is Black, lack of vehicle access is prevalent for 74.8% of the population while the
                average median income across those tracts is also less than $40k. In contrast, predominantly White
                tracts show a much lower poverty rate and overall higher median income, suggesting that vehicle
                access and distance from the nearest supermarket are the more dominant factors in those tracts.

            </h6>
            <p>
                In doing this analysis, we found that while certain races (e.g., White) may have a large number of
                tracts containing food deserts, those tracts are only a small number of the total count where that same race is
                dominant (e.g., only 9% of the predominantly White tracts are marked as food deserts).
                This observation is consistent with our other findings (see Figure 1).
                The food desert statistics aggregated in the figure above tell a more nuanced story and help to
                highlight that each race may face significantly different challenges and underlying causes in their
                food desert situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, this analysis comes with a major caveat since we've assigned race labels to tracts purely on
                the basis of which race has the largest population in that tract.
                This could be a fairly noisy measurement in general which might corrupt the statistics shown in the
                above figures. Furthermore, ascribing the income, poverty, and vehicle access statistics in this way
                could also be misleading since we've assumed that race is a causal factor for these variables.
                In fact, there may be no strong causal link in reality in which case, the above figures may not provide
                us many insights overall. However, since tracts are reasonably small in terms of total population, we
                believe that identifying a tract by the race contributing the most individuals to its population is
                still a reasonable assumption for enabling us to study some of the deeper factors related to food desert
                prevalence.

                <h2>Food Deserts in Maryland</h2>
                <p> As students at Johns Hopkins, we decided it would be useful and important to examine food security data 
                    specific to the state of Maryland. As with the US map visualization above, hover over individual counties 
                    to display what percentage of the population of that county lives in a tract labeled as a food desert.
                    Additionally, click on each county to see the racial demographics of that county displayed in the bar chart
                    below. When observing these visualizations together, one can see that, frequently, populations of color exist 
                    in a higher percentage in
                    the county's food deserts than they do in the overall county demographics, emphasizing that the effect of food
                    insecurity is not felt equally by all races or groups. This suggests, as stated before, that the issue of food 
                    deserts is deeply connected to 
                    systematic racism, and disproportionately affects BIPOC populations more than white populations.

                Conclusions
            </h2>
            <p>
                We find that food deserts are a significant issue facing much of the United States.  On the surface,
                many of the statistics do not suggest any disparities for racial minorities, but our deeper analysis
                uncovers that food deserts are disproportionately impactful as a function of race, demographic, and
                geography.  We find that the factors affecting each subpopulation are often different and vary from low income to
                challenges with vehicle access.  Overall, the unequal effects of food desert prevalence on minority
                and vulnerable groups are measurable. We believe that access to healthy food should be universal and
                hope that this project helps to raise awareness for this issue.
